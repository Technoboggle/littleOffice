Little office of the Blessed Virgin Mary

MorningEvening.pdf is mostly Prime and Compline.

We use the little blue books from Baronius Press, but they don't mark the accents and the music is in an appendix so they are not all that convenient until you are very familiar with the Little Office.  Baronius Press also uses the Douay-Rheims - not the Challoner revision - which is great, but when you're used to the Challoner then it can be a bit off-putting.
