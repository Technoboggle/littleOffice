\psalmverse{}{Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.}
\psalmverse{}{O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.}
\psalmverse{}{For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.}
\psalmverse{}{For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.}
\psalmverse{}{Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy truth.}
\psalmverse{}{I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:}
\psalmverse{}{For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.}
\psalmverse{}{Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.}
\psalmverse{}{As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen.}
