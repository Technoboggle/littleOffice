\psalmverse{}{Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.}
\psalmverse{}{Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins.}
\psalmverse{}{Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.}
\psalmverse{}{Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us.}
\psalmverse{}{Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?}
\psalmverse{}{Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall rejoice in thee.}
\psalmverse{}{Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.}
\psalmverse{}{I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak peace unto his people:}
\psalmverse{}{And unto his saints: and unto them that are converted to the heart.}
\psalmverse{}{Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.}
\psalmverse{}{Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.}
\psalmverse{}{Truth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down from heaven.}
\psalmverse{}{For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her fruit.}
\psalmverse{}{Justice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the way.}
\psalmverse{}{Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.}
\psalmverse{}{As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen.}
